### Exercise 1

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# TODO: This needs to be auto-generated as well. Should be pretty easy to do this part of it, but we have no support as yet for "Exercise" naming.

  kable("latex", escape=FALSE, booktabs=TRUE, align='llr', linesep='\\addlinespace') %>%
  row_spec(nrow(ex)-1, hline_after = TRUE) %>%
  row_spec(nrow(ex), bold = TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(2, width="13cm")
```

### Exercise 2

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# TODO: This needs to be auto-generated as well. Should be pretty easy to do this part of it, but we have no support as yet for "Exercise" naming.

### Exercise 3

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# TODO: This needs to be auto-generated as well. Should be pretty easy to do this part of it, but we have no support as yet for "Exercise" naming.
