1.1,4,1,"Sheep D17 was replaced with D17 on 10 July. Note that A14 also seems to have been removed, but wasn't replaced. There's lots of ways to do this one, including just looking at the data. As long as students have specified the method used, and the method used results in the correct answer in a logical fashion, all good. [4]",NULL
1.2,5,1,"A boxplot by farmlet is probably what we want here.

It seems the farmlet weights are comparable at day 0 - i.e. average weight seems to be about the same across all farmlets. The spread is also fairly similar between
the farmlets [5].",NULL
1.3,6,1,"Must be a plot showing individual sheep over time, no averaging. General trend is for growth, as might be expected. Farmlet B maybe grows a bit faster. There's a clear decrease in farmlet C and B around mid-July (and lesser so on other farmlets). This decrease is likely due to when the sheep were crutched. We can see this by looking through the data for the crutched variable where the first date is 13 July. Axis labels should be appropriate (Date is better than Day here!) with units. Unnecessary legends (particularly per-sheep ones!) should be removed (not too bad if farmlet has a legend unnecessarily) [6]",NULL
2.1,4,1,"From the anova table we see that farmlet is important, and from the summary table, day and crutching is also important. Overall $R^2$ is 0.43 suggesting the model explains 43% of variation in weight - this wouldn't be too good for predicting individual weight. Farmlet B seems 2.1kg heavier than A, Farmlet C 1.66kg heavier than A and farmlet D 2.8kg) heavier than A. Day effect suggests animals gain around 170g each day. Crutching lowers weight by 2.1kg. [4] (optional: The intercept here represents day 0 farmlet A, uncrutched).",NULL
2.2,6,1,"The intercept in this model represents the Day 0 weight of crutched sheep on farmlet A (60.4kg). [1]

There is no real evidence for a differential effect of time on weight (i.e. different growth) as the P-value in the ANOVA table for the interction term `Day:Farmlet` is high (P=0.85). [2]

Growth rate on each farmlet is about 160g/day from the coefficient of `Day` in the summary table. This applies to Farmlet A, but the other farmlets don't differ much (we know the differences aren't important), with farmlet B growing only 14g faster, farmlet C 5g faster, and farmlet D 23g faster, but there is quite a lot of uncertainty in these measures (about 25g) from standard error column. Thus our conclusion would be that the sheep grow similarly on each farmlet, at about 160-170g per day. [3]",NULL
2.3,3,1,"The second model (with interaction included) makes the most sense for this study. While the interaction term isn't important, nonetheless it makes sense to include it, as we would expect there to possibly be some difference in growth rates, as each farmlet has a different rotation, thus different access to grass, so potentially different energy intake.

The key concept is whether the model makes sense for the problem. They don't have to reference the lack of statistical importance necessarily [3].",NULL
2.4,4,1,"The day effect is very similar across all farmlets, with A maybe being a little slower growing, but well within the confidence interval. The effect of crutching is clear, and the effect is the same across each farmlet as the model enforces this. Possibly star for students recognising the crutching effect is the same because of model structure [4].",NULL
2.5,4,1,"Linearity and equal variance look fine as no trend and reasonably constant scatter in Residuals vs Fitted plot. Normality isn't a concern anyway for estimating means/coefficients, but the normal QQ plot is pretty good anyway. No concern on residuals vs leverage plot. We can't assess independence here [4].",NULL
2.6,5,1,"We know independence assumption is almost certainly not met, as nothing in our model accounts for the between-sheep variability and the fact that the weights are clustered by sheep (as per the individual weights plot in the first exercise). Whether it's bad or not depends just how violated the independence assumption is - it may be that the standard errors in our model might be a bit small, which means our P-values are too small which means our conclusions might need moderating.

We can fix it by adding sheep to the model. This is best done with a mixed model as a random effect, else we won't be able to generalise to future years.

Could visualise residuals, fix with lme, and check fix by visualising residuals [5].",NULL
3.1,10,1,"Students are expected to comment on the statement given. The intention is for them to relate what they know about the farmlets (that rotation length will likely influence grass intake) to what we see in the study, where there doesn't seem to be much difference between farmlets. i.e. while the farmlets place different availability of grass to each sheep, it doesn't seem to make much difference in this study. Otherwise, they should have an overall conclusion of no real difference between farmlets in terms of sheep growth (though there is an average weight difference if independence isn't considered, and not much difference at the start), and that crutching drops weight by 2kg or so. [10]

I'd tend to mark this question qualitatively. i.e. allocate marks based on 10 being A+, 5 being a C, 2 being an E etc.",NULL
