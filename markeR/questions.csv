1.1,4,1,"A boxplot by month is likely best. No marks if there are no changes to the provided plot at all. [2]

Most milk is in Spring (Sep->Nov), with the least in autumn (March to May). There's a few outliers in May. The spreads are similar across months, as are the shapes (reasonably symmetric) [2]

Main point being centers change is biggest thing to notice. They **must** have correct axis labels/month names to get all the marks for the plot. Effort to get the x-axis labels correct should be rewarded. They need to have the y-axis label correct. Vet students may well include the why. This is OK as well, and can be ignored.","list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(    list(list(list(""Would be better with month names instead of numbers"",         ""What about spread and shape?""), ""Need proper axis labels""),         ""Unit?""), ""What about spread, shape and outliers?""),     ""Imprecise y-axis label""), ""You cannot comment on the shape of a series of boxplot: this is not a curve""),     ""Careful : Month 1 is not January but June""), ""The points represent farms and not individual cows""),     ""Be more concise: give the general trends""), ""You cannot comment on the skewness of a group of boxplots""),     ""No, all boxplots have similar spread and shapes""), ""Need more comments""),     ""Description?""), ""A barplot is not appropriate here: better to use a boxplot""),     ""Outliers are not necessarily data errors""))"
1.2,4,1,"A boxplot by year is probably what we want here [2]. Some students might try another plot here (e.g. a line plot through time by region maybe?). Anything that gives a suitable answer is OK.

There doesn't seem to be much change in milk yield over time with the centers being similar. No strong evidence of an increase over time (i.e. any increase is small). Spreads are reasonably similar as is shape (fairly symmetric) [2].

1.3,4,1,"A `subset` command is probably the most efficient method. All values were from the East Coast [1]. Any suitable method for getting this (including plotting) is fine.

1.4,4,1,"A boxplot by region, facetted by island is what I came up with, but this is just one of many possible graphs [3]. Overall conclusion is that there is some variation by region in terms of the center. The spreads are reasonably similar [1].

2.1,4,1,"I'd do a histogram facetted by island, or maybe a density. Must have axes labelled correctly [2].

2.2,4,1,"The plot should have correct units. I prefer original scale (i.e. log axes) but logged values are OK if clearly marked as such [2].

2.3,4,1,"We expect the average somatic cell count in south island to be between 209 and 224 (000s/cow/day), while in the north island it's between 232 and 242 [1]. There does seem to be statistical evidence of a difference as there is no common value that matches both intervals (the CIs don't overlap) [3].

Students must have produced separate CIs for each island. i.e. not a two-sample t-test. They don't have to use the log's - if they do the answers will be 5.3-5.36 for south and 5.42-5.45 for north respectively, so the conclusion will be the same - the t.test doesn't rely on the distribution of the sample/population so much when the sample size is large. A coherent explanation as to whether there is a difference is needed based on their CIs (i.e. they don't overlap) is required for the marks.

2.4,4,1,"I'd use a boxplot by month facetted by island, with SCC on a log scale [2].

There seems to be a lower somatic cell count on average in the south island compared to the north. The spreads and distribution are similar though. A key thing to note is that the south island is actually similar to the north (maybe higher than) during June through September, and it's only Oct through May that south island has a lower SCC. A key point is the seasonality is a bit different between islands, so they need to comment on that specifically for full marks [2].

Some students will use raw SCC here.

3.1,4,1,"A scatterplot coloured by island is probably what is wanted, but only award full marks if you can clearly see the differing trends between the islands [2].

There is a strong increasing linear relationship between milk fat and milk. This seems to be a bit different between north and south islands in that the slope differs between the regions, with the south island being flatter (i.e. more milk fat at lower milk yields, and similar at higher yields) [2].

Some students may attempt to compare correlations or linear model fits (slopes) but that is not required. Feel free to add comments if they do on whether it tells them what they want to know - I suspect a linear model with interaction term for slope is needed here really.","list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(list(    list(list(list(list(list(""Units?"", ""Flatter slope for the south island""),         ""strong positive linear relationship""), ""Better to plot both island together to see the differences in slope""),         ""incorrect units""), ""Flatter slope for the north island""),     ""Incorrect interpretation of the slope""), ""You should have drawn a scatterplot""),     ""The second plot is really not clear""), ""not clear""), ""You should have used a linear regression slope""),     ""comment?""), ""The second plot is not appropriate""), ""The R^2 doesn't give information about the slope of the relationship""),     ""Better to plot the regression line with the scatterplot""),     ""The line graph is not appropriate""), ""You should have drawn this second plot to answer for the question 3.1 and not 3.2""),     ""The colour by month is not needed""))"
3.2,4,1,"The hypothesis to test is whether average milk yield is the same between north and south islands (i.e. difference between the means will be 0). There is strong evidence (P < 0.0001) for a difference. We expect the South island to yield 1-2 litres more on average with 95% confidence [4].

They need to correctly state the hypothesis (either null or alternate is fine) and have the correct interpretation from the P-value. Please remove a mark if they compare their P-value to a threshold (e.g. 0.05), and clearly indicate that this is bad practice. Instead they should go by magnitude. Exact values for P or CIs could also result in a mark off: values are expressing uncertainty, so don't need to be overly precise. A clear conclusion of a difference is required, and the magnitude of the difference needs to be specified as well, including uncertainty.
